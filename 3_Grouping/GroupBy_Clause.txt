Before going to learn group By first we need to learn Aggregrate Function.

1) Aggregrate Functions : Aggregate Functions are used to summarize the data . In sql, we mainly use 5 aggregate functions.
                          Those are :

                          a) SUM(<column_name>) : Finds sum of all elements in that column
                          b) AVG(<column_name>) : Finds average values of all columns
                          c) Min(<column_name>) : Finds minimum value in a column
                          d) Max(<column_name>) : Finds maximum value in a column
                          e) Count() : Count all non null rows in a table. It doesn't require arguments as input.

                          Ex : Select Sum(amount) As Total_Amount From payments

2) Group BY : Group By clause is used to Group Aggregations By specific columns.

             Syntax : Select Aggregate_Function(<col_name>) From <Table_name> Group By <col_name>

             Ex : Select Sum(amount) From payments Group BY customer_id

             Note : In Group By clause, the columns u want to display must be present in aggregate function or 
                    in Group By clause.

                    For example, 
                    Select payment_id, sum(amount) from payment Group By customer_id

                    If you run this query, then u get error such as payment_id should be present atleast in 
                    aggregate_function or group by clause. But its not present in both. So it will produce an 
                    error.

                    If you want to Group By multiple columns then we just need mention all the columns next to group by
                    clause. But First column is unique and the next columns can have duplicate values.

3) Having Clause : 'Having' Clause is used to filter the Groupping by aggregations.

             Syntax : Select <aggregation_type>,column_name From <table_name>
                      Group By <column_name>
                      Having condition 

                      Here this condition is based on aggregations.
                      condition : count(*) > 2 . The conditions are similar to this.
