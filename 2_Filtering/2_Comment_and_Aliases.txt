1) Comments in Sql : We can write comments in SQL by using these syntax

                    a) Single line Comments : We can write single line comments in SQL like this 
                     
                     Syntax : --<comment you want to write>

                     Ex : --Filtering out customer_id and customer name

                     b) Multi Line Comments : We can write multi line comments by using /* */

                     Syntax : /*  Comment_1
                                  Comment_2
                                  Comment_3
                                              */
                     Ex : /* Filter customer_id and customer_name from customers table_name
                             Now Find how many customer's start with Adam.   */

2) Aliases : Aliases is simply as assign alternate name for particular column or database tempproryly not permanently.
             I mean we won't change name of the column in the database. We just convert the names into descriptive manner
             using aliases.

             Syntax : Select Count(*) As First_name_as_Adam from customer 
                      Where first_name = 'Adam'
