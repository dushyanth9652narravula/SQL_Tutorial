1) SELECT : Select query is used to select the columns present in a table.

            Syntax : SELECT column_name FROM table_name

            Here you can select as many as columns u want by just seperating column names with a comma.

            Ex : Select address, district from Address

            You can select all columns in the table by using this '*' symbol.

            Ex : Select * From Address


2) ORDER BY : 'ORDER BY' is generally used to sort the data in a column alphabetically or numerically or chronologically
              based on the data type of column.

              Syntax : Select column_name From table_name ORDER BY column_name

              By default Order By sorts the data in the column in ascending order.

              If you want it in decesnding order then u can use 'Desc' keyword in the end

              Syntax : Select column_name From table_name ORDER BY column_name Desc

                                            (or)

                       Select column_name From table_name ORDER BY column_name Asc (For Ascending Order)

              Suppose u have duplicate entries in a column then u can sort data with multiple columns using ORDER BY
              Keyword.

              Syntax : Select column_name From table_name ORDER BY coulmn_name_1, column_name_2

              Ex : Select firstname, lastname, email from customer Order By lastname , firstname

              This query first sort the lastname in ascending order and then sort firstname for each unique entries in
              lastname. 

3) SELECT DISTINCT : Select Distinct Query is used to select distinct elements present in that column only.

                     Syntax : Select Distinct column_name from table_name

                     Ex : Select Distinct last_name from customer

                     This selects the distinct names present in the last_name column.

                     Suppose if u give multiple columns to Select Distinct, then it will give distinct elements of the
                     combination of columns.

                     Ex : Select Distinct last_name, first_name from customer

4) Limit : Limit command is used to limit the rows in the table. Suppose if you want to display only first 10 rows in 
           a table then we can use 'Limit' Command.

           Limit Command always present at the end of the query.

           Syntax : Select column_name From table_name Limit number

           Where 'number' is an integer which indicates no of rows we want.

           Ex : Select * From customer Limit 5

5) Count() : Count() is used to count the no of rows present in the output. This function doesn't count the null values
             present in a row. That means if null values are present in that row then this function doesn't count that 
             row.

             Syntax : Select Count(*) From Customer.

             Note : Count() takes only one argument.

             We can combine this Count() function with the Distinct Keyword.

             Ex : Select Count(Distinct last_name) From Customer 

             But here we can give argument like this "Distinct last_name, first_name" . Because if u give argument
             like this then it considers it as two arguments. So this will produce an error if u provide argument like
             this.
