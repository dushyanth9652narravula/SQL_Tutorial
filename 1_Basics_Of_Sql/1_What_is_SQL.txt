Before going to learn about SQL, lets see what is a database.

Database : A Database is simply an organized collection of data stored in a computer system.Usually data is stored as 
           tables in database.

           Each database has a schema which is used to structure the databases.

           To manage these databases we have a software called Database Management System (DBMS). There are so many DBMS
           in the market such as :

                a) Postgresql
                b) Mysql
                c) MariaDB
                d) MySQL Server etc.


SQL : SQL stands for Structured Query Language.This is used to interact with the databases.Interacting simply means 
      retrieving the data, updating the data, Analyzing the data by using joins , Group By etc.

The reason why we need to learn SQL is :

    1) Data is everywhere.And all these data is stored in databases.So we need to know how to interact with this databases.
    2) SQL is most important skill if you want to be :

            a) Data Analyst
            b) Data Scientist
            c) Business Analyst
