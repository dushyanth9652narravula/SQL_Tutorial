WHERE Clause : WHERE Clause is used to filter the data.This clause always comes after the 'FROM' Clause.

                  Syntax : Select column_name From table_name WHERE Condition

                  Ex : Select * From payments Where price = 0

                  This gives the all payments with amount = 0

                  Here we have so many comparision operators in SQL for writing the condition.

                  Comparision Operators : 

                        = : Equal to operators
                        > : Greater than
                        < : Less than
                        >=: Greater than or Equal to
                        <=: Less than or Equal to
                        !=: Not equal to 
                        is null : checks whether value is null or Not
                        is not null : opposite to is null


                  Ex : Select * From payments Where price > 10

                  Logical Operators : Logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions. There are two 
                                      logical operators in sql.

                                      a) AND : Which produces true if both c1 and c2 are true.
                                      b) OR : It produces true if either c1 or c2 becomes true.


                   Ex : Select * From payments where price > 10 AND price < 12

                   BETWEEN Keyword : Between Keyword is used to check in a range (a,b). Here both a and b are included.
                                     
                                     Ex : Select * From payment Where amount Between 1.99 AND 6.99 

                                     Here 1.99 and 6.99 are included.

                                     These Between keyword is also used to check condition for dates also.

                                     Ex : Select * From rental Where rental_date Between 'date_1' AND 'date_2'

                                     If date include time zones then these automatically converted into

                                     '2024-09-01 0:00' AND '2024-09-15 0:00'. If you use this then we can get rental_date
                                     in between 01 and 15 only. But here 15 is not included. So to include 15 date then 
                                     we manually enter for that date like this '2024-09-15 12:00'

                                     Ex : Select * From rental where rental_date Between '2024-09-01' AND '2024-09-15 12:00'

                                     Here Between keyword only takes date in the format of 'yyyy-mm-dd' format.

                  
                  In Keyword : In keyword is used to filter the data by using a list of elements. Here we check 
                               elements are present in list . That means if you have multiple 'OR' conditions 
                               in where clause, we can use 'In' keywors instead of multiple 'Or' conditions

                               Ex : Select * From customers where customer_id In (123,125,127,135.137)
